# Titanic EDA - Task 5 

## 📌 Objective
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook


## 📁 Dataset
[Titanic Dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data?select=train.csv)

## 🧪 Exploratory Steps

- Loaded and cleaned missing values in Age, Embarked, and dropped Cabin
- Descriptive Statistics and Info
- Value counts of categorical features
- Univariate: Histograms, CountPlots, BoxPlots
- Bivariate/Multivariate: Heatmap, Pairplot, Scatterplots

## 📊 Key Visuals
- Survival vs Gender
- Age Distribution
- Heatmap of Correlation
- Pairplot (Age, Fare, Pclass vs Survived)

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Females had a higher survival rate than males
- 1st class passengers had more survival chances
- Younger passengers had higher survival
- Fare and class showed positive correlation with survival
